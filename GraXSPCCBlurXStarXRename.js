#feature-id    ProcessAndRename
#feature-info  Applies GradientCorrection, SPCC, BlurXTerminator, and StarXTerminator with a UI and renaming capability.

/*
 * Script: Process and Rename with UI
 * * Includes:
 * - UI to toggle stages
 * - Renaming logic (Selectable)
 * - Handles separate "Stars" image renaming if StarXTerminator is used
